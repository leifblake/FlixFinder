# FlixFinder
This repository is for FlixFinder, a personal project created using React.js and TailwindCSS. Users can search for their favorite movies and results will be autopopulated, showing ratings, language, and release year. Integrated with an API from TMDB, and uses Appwrite Database to collect metrics on searches (to create the "Trending Movies" section)
